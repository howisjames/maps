# maps
These are various custom web maps created for travel and tourism purposes.

**all of these are presently broken because they utilize TableTop.js which is unable to access Gsheet data due to Google's changed API. Need to switch to Chris Arderne's solution using PapaParse.js**

## nassau
Points of interest for a walking tour of Nassau Bahamas.
Based on code from:
https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet
I've not been able to get the color coded marker pins working. Relies on the now obsolete Tabletop.js.


## burnsville
 Sightseeing points of interest in the Appalachian mountains around Burnsville, NC
 Also based on code from:
https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet
Still no color-coded markers.

## texas-campgrounds
 Locations of promising campsites for tent camping in Texas. Based on **The Best in Tent Camping Texas** by Wendel Withrow.
Based on code from:
https://github.com/carderne/leaflet-gsheets
Finally! Color coded markers! This codebase made the switch from Tabletop.js to PapaParse.js to overcome a data access issue imposed by Google during 2020.
