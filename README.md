# maps
These are various custom web maps created for travel and tourism purposes.

## nassau
Points of interest for a walking tour of Nassau Bahamas.
Based on code from:
https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet
I've not been able to get the color coded marker pins working. Relies on the now obsolete Tabletop.js.


## burnsville
 Sightseeing points of interest in the Appalachian mountains around Burnsville, NC
 Also based on code from:
https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet
Still no color-coded markers.

## texas-campgrounds
 Locations of promising campsites for tent camping in Texas. Based on **The Best in Tent Camping Texas** by Wendel Withrow.
Based on code from:
https://github.com/carderne/leaflet-gsheets
Finally! Color coded markers! This codebase made the switch from Tabletop.js to PapaParse.js to overcome a data access issue imposed by Google during 2020.
